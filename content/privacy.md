- **Legal obligation:** where processing is required by law.

## 6. Cookies, Analytics, and Similar Technologies

Kiby currently does **not** operate a website cookie banner/cookie system and does **not** use its own cookie-based tracking setup at this time.

If cookie-based tracking or non-essential analytics is introduced in a future web surface, this Policy will be updated before deployment.
